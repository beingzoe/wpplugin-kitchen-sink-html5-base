for developing WordPress themes (and possibly other plugins) including semantic
HTML5 awesomeness via HTML5 Boilerplate. Various classes and methods for rapidly
implementing admin pages, options, metaboxes, and all that stuff you put
in every functions.php or plugin file you've ever made. ;)

== Installation ==

1) Download, install, and activate the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" plugin

    It doesn't do anything until you ask it to in your theme ;)

    You can also clone the repo on github and include it directly, up to you.
    $ git clone git://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base.git


2) Activate one of the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" starter themes

    * kitchen-sink-html5-base-dev-starter

    OR if this is your first time, consider downloading one of the demo themes:
    https://github.com/beingzoe/wptheme-kitchen-sink-html5-twentyeleven

3) Make your theme with optimized HTML5 awesomeness and a clean functions.php

    Once you have invoked the plugin in your theme you can include and use as much
    as little of the libraries and functionality as you like.


4) Enjoy and become internet famous
