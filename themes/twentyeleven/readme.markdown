Base theme for developing client themes.

== Description ==

This is a PARENT THEME and does NOTHING MEANINGFUL without a child theme.
This is a developers theme for developers or people who really want to 
write and edit some CSS, Javascript, and PHP.

Not only is Kitchen Sink NOT a ready-to-go theme, 
it needs a child theme to work it's magic.

The purpose of Kitchen Sink is to provide a meaningful base 
for rapid development of awesome custom themes as child themes.

It is called Kitchen Sink because it comes with a little bit of everything 
and you'll be doing as much deleting as creating when you start your child theme.

Note that while this is a theme development base intended for developers or serious 
web design enthusiasts the parent theme and child base themes have been commented 
heavily to aid the beginner in it's usage and customization.
