Demo theme showing off some of the awesomeness of the Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base

== Description ==

Looks like Twenty Ten but grooves with the awesomeness of HTML5 Boilerplate

In the meantime be aware that this demo theme is unstable for production use.

Download, clone, or fork at https://github.com/organizations/kitchen-sink



== Installation ==

1) Download, install, and activate the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" plugin

    It doesn't do anything until you ask it to in your theme ;)

    You can also clone the repo on github and include it directly, up to you.
    $ git clone git://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base.git


2) Download, install, and activate one of the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" starter themes

    * kitchen-sink-html5-base-starter       ( Sensible defaults only )

    Coming soon:
    * kitchen-sink-html5-base-stripped      ( Just the shell to build from )
    * kitchen-sink-html5-base-documented    ( heavily commented like a walkthrough )

    You can also clone the repos on github each time you start a new theme
    $ git clone git://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base.git your_new_theme_name


3) Make your theme with optimized HTML5 awesomeness and a clean functions.php

    Once you have invoked the plugin in your theme you can include and use as much
    as little of the libraries and functionality as you like.


4) Enjoy and become internet famous
