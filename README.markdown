# Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base #

WordPress Theme and Plugin development base to use as a sensible starting point
for developing WordPress themes (and possibly other plugins) including semantic
HTML5 awesomeness via HTML5 Boilerplate. Various classes and methods for rapidly
implementing admin pages, options, metaboxes, and all that stuff you put
in every functions.php or plugin file you've ever made. ;)


## Description ##

See the Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base wiki at github for details
https://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base/wiki

Download, clone, or fork at https://github.com/organizations/kitchen-sink



## Installation ##

1) Download, install, and activate the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" plugin

It doesn't do anything until you ask it to in your theme ;)

You can also clone the repo on github and include it directly, up to you.
$ git clone git://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base.git

1b) OR download/clone and include in your theme directly
http://beingzoe.com/zui/wordpress/kitchen_sink/
$ git clone git://github.com/beingzoe/wpplugin-kitchen-sink-html5-base.git

2) Invoke the plugin, include the parts you want/need, make your theme

//2b) require_once the location of the plugin then do step 2
//    The current implementation makes this impossible but will be reimplemented

See http://beingzoe.com/zui/wordpress/kitchen_sink/ for complete usage reference and checklist
(Well actually that just sends you back here mostly ;)

# Optionally #

Download, install, and activate one of the "Kitchen Sink HTML5 Base" starter themes
to have all the awesomeness you need really actually ready-to-go

COMING SOON!!!

Make your theme with optimized HTML5 awesomeness and a clean functions.php
Once you have invoked the plugin in your theme you can include and use as much
as little of the libraries and functionality as you like.

Enjoy and become internet famous
